# OffbeatDB-TravelApp

Project Overview:
**Offbeat Travels** is a web-based application that manages travel bookings and inquiries. The application uses Flask for the web server, MySQL for relational data storage, and MongoDB for non-relational data like FAQs and logs.

File Structure:
- offbeat-env/: Contains the virtual environment setup for the project.
- static/: Holds all static content used by the web application, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- templates/: Contains HTML files which define the structure and layout of the web application's pages.
- airports.csv: A CSV file containing data about different airports, used to populate the MySQL database.
- international_flights.csv: A CSV file containing data about flights, used to populate the MySQL database.
- app.py: The main Flask application file that starts the web server.
- create_db.py: Python script that initializes the MySQL database with the required tables and schema.
- populate_faq.py: Python script used to populate the MongoDB database with frequently asked questions for the FAQ section of the web application.
- utils.py: Contains utility functions and helpers used across the project.
- readMe.txt: This file, providing documentation on the project setup and instructions on how to run the application.
- requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project that should be installed using pip after activating the virtual environment.

Pre-requisites:  
    Python 3.x  
    MySQL  
    MongoDB  
    Flask  
    Virtual Environment Tools  
    pip for Python Package Management  

Initial Setup  
A. Environment Setup:  
    1. Download the Project  
    2. Navigate to Project Directory:  
        `cd path/to/OffbeatTravels`  
    3. Activate Virtual Environment:  
        `source offbeat-env/bin/activate`   # On Windows use `offbeat-venv\Scripts\activate`  
    4. Install Dependencies:  
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
B. Database Setup:  
    MySQL  
        1. Install MySQL  
            macOS: `brew install mysql`  
        2. Start MySQL Shell:  
            `mysql -u root -p`  
        3. Create MySQL User:  
            `CREATE USER 'offbeat_traveler'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '12345678';`  
            `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'offbeat_traveler'@'localhost';`  
            `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`  
    MongoDB  
        1. Install MongoDB (Link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)  
        2. If you already have MongoDB with authentication, skip to to step 10  
        3. Disable authentication:  
            Edit config file:  
                macOS: `nano /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf`  
            Comment out the security authorization line by adding a # in front of it:
                # security:  
                #   authorization: enabled  
        4. Start MongoDB:  
            macOS: `sudo brew services start mongodb-community@7.0`  
        5. Access MongoDB Shell:  
            `mongosh`  
        6. Create Admin User in MongoDB:  
            `use admin`  
            `db.createUser({  
                user: "admin",  
                pwd: "Dsci-551",  
                roles: ["root"]  
            });`  
        7. Stop MongoDB:  
            macOS: `sudo brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0`  
        8. Reenable authentication by removing the # added in front of the security authorization line in part 3  
            macOS: `nano /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf`  
        9. Restart MongoDB:  
            macOS: `sudo brew services start mongodb-community@7.0`  
        10. Access MongoDB with Authentication:  
            `mongosh -u admin -p`  
        11. Create New MongoDB User:  
            `db.createUser({  
              user: "offbeat_traveler",  
              pwd: "12345678",  
              roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "travels"}]  
            });`  

Running the Application:  
1. Make sure that MySQL and MongoDB services are running and that the appropriate users were created.  
2. In "OffbeatTravels" directory, set environment variables:  
    macOS/Linux:  
        `export FLASK_APP=app.py`  
    Windows:  
        `set FLASK_APP=app.py`  
3. Initialize Database:  
    `python populate_faq.py`  
    `python create_db.py`  
4. Start Flask Application:  
    `flask run`  

This will start the web server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default
